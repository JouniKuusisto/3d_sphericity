# 3d Sphericity
For calculating 3D sphericity of left atrium of human heart in medical imaging. 

This code is built for own academic use and is rough around the edges. It is used to calculate parameters and visualize data for a research paper which is currently submitted for review.

3D sphericity is (3DS) is our proposal for index of spherecity in medical imaging. Principle is described already in 1935 by H. Wadell in the field of Geology. doi:10.1086/624298

Left atrial sphericity (LASP) is proposed by Bisbal et al. in 2013. This parameter is calculated here per description they provide in supplement of their article.
